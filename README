# DEPI Project 1: Image Classification and Object Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **DEPI Program** and focuses on building a system for **Image Classification** and **Object Detection** using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  
The goal is to automatically classify images into categories and detect objects within images with high accuracy.  
Additionally, we are integrating **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** functionality to assist **visually impaired users** by reading out the detected objects and image classifications.
